If the site undergoes an inspection, then Thaad cannot be deployed within the year as it takes more than a year.
At the Shangri-La Dialogue, Defense Minister Han Min-koo also delivered President Moon’s position on the issue to Mattis by saying that the government’s effort to find the truth behind the omission is a purely domestic decision, not an attempt to overturn the previous government’s decision to deploy concerns are deepening in South Korea after Moon ordered an investigation into the suspicion that the Defense Ministry concealed the placement of four additional Thaad launchers to avoid a strategic assessment of the missile shield’s environmental impact.
As Pyongyang is expected to install nuclear warheads on its missiles soon, Thaad should be deployed within the year.

Moon must talk out disagreements and misunderstandings when he meets Trump later this month.
Many analysts in Seoul and Washington are predicting poor chemistry between U.S. President Donald Trump and Korean President Moon Jae-in, who champions more engagement of North Korea and challenges the deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) antimissile system in Korea.
According to some local reports, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, said Washington could use the $923 million of U.S. taxpayers’ money — the cost of the Thaad system — elsewhere if Korea does not want it.
Union groups protested strongly upon learning of his appointment, claiming he would advocate more for the employers, as he had been a career bureaucrat in the industry sector and served as the vice chairman of the Korea International Trade Association.
The secretary on job creation is a new post under President Moon Jae-in, who has made job creation a top economic priority. Someone with faults should not be seated in the presidential office, regardless of capabilities.
The Blue House initially said Ahn had been recruited because he was knowledgeable in the field of industry and trade and therefore suitable for refereeing among the labor, employers and government.

When a group of business lobbying groups released their response to President Moon Jae-in’s key economic policies, I found myself understanding what both sides had to say.
After a consultative body for the KEF released a report Thursday describing its members’ opinions of the economic agenda of the new government, much backpeddling was seen and heard. Earlier, the KEF withdrew a plan to distribute a booklet entitled “The Misunderstanding and Truth behind Our Irregular the meantime, our workplaces have been thrown into confusion. For instance, 75 former and current workers for Coupang, one of Korea’s largest online shopping companies, submitted petitions to Moon about their allegedly unfair dismissals from the company.
The problem is the lack of any constructive dialogue between the liberal government and the corporate sector.
Though Coupang explained that it has suffered huge losses, the conflict is intensified by the government’s push to have contract workers upgraded. After SK Broadband tried to improve the status of its internet installation technicians, over 100 contractors sued the company for the effect on them.

Lately, researchers at major American military and security think tanks are touring Seoul and other regions to meet with Korean nuclear policy researchers, scientists and engineers. The topic of the interview is the possibility of Korea’s nuclear armament. As North Korea is accelerating its nuclear and missiles development, discussion of Korea’s possible nuclear armament in private institutes and academia in the United States has been partially exposed.
In the ever-changing equation of international politics, the North Korean nuclear program could be a rotten apple in the basket of Chinese security.
When Korea can no longer live with a nuclear presence to the North and finally goes nuclear, China’s security and the unification policy will become entangled. We cannot rule out the possibility of a nuclear Japan and Taiwan.
The Blue House said Wednesday that the Ministry of National Defense had intentionally deleted sensitive wording from a briefing for President Moon Jae-in. Though a draft report specified that a total of six launchers for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system (Thaad) were safely held at a U.S. military base in South Korea, the number ended up as two in the ministry’s final briefing of the president, the presidential office says.
The four additional launchers cannot be activated anytime soon.
The government must not allow a schism between the presidential office and the defense ministry to the Blue House’ probe of the incident, the Thaad deployment may have to stop for a while.
It should be the industry and energy ministry that redesigns energy supply outline including what to do with nuclear plants.
A hasty transition could trigger a supply shortage, blackout, and spike in electricity bills. The government sets two-year energy supply plan based on outlook for 15-year supply capacity. The Swiss government also has envisioned a phase-out from nuclear power, but works against a timetable until the year 2050.
But it is not up to the NSSC to decide closures of nuclear power plants, as it is an organization responsible for overseeing safety of their operation.
So President Moon Jae-in’s drastic policy promises are convincing and meaningful. On the argument that all problems can be solved in the market, John Maynard Keynes said, “In the long run, we are all order to accomplish the good intention of Moon’s promise, it is necessary to implement detailed policies.
It was the time when new terms like “NEET,” not in education, employment or training, and “freeter” to described the underemployed, were coined. Twenty years have passed, and youth unemployment has fallen to 4 percent now.
However, many of the “lost generations,” now in their mid- to late-40s still are unstable. They have been alienated from the regular labor market.
When Moon really wants to put politicians in top government positions, it should be confined to those areas that require political senses and skills.
After his nomination of former South Jeolla Gov. Lee Nak-yon as prime minister was expected to pass the confirmation procedure, Moon announced picks for other top posts in the administration.
Recommended by the ruling party, the new faces reflect the president’s pursuit of regional and gender balances for his cabinet as political analysts believe Moon was most concerned about recruiting people who could be confirmed by the National Assembly.

Because 95 percent of our non-regular workforce is hired by small and midsize companies and mom-and-pop stores, the government should take a careful approach by reducing those jobs while minimizing the impact.
Some economists point out that if the government sticks to its belief that the types of jobs should be removed as they are bad, it only will worsen our job market.
Kim said that the conflict between employers and employees will deepen if the new administration presses ahead with its new labor policy of reducing the number of non-regular workers so they can work as full-time, salaried workers as their regular counterparts do.

What the government should aim to do is remove any controversy and confusion regarding textbook policy by ensuring accuracy, objectivity and balance in publication.

Ordinary citizens have demanded union members restrain from making such radical requests as the legalization of the teachers union or release of its hard-line unions’ demands for rewards for jumping on the bandwagon is an insult to the people.

The Seoul Central District Court ruled last week that the introduction of a performance-based pay system by the Korea Housing &amp; Urban Guarantee Corporation without the consent of its labor union was null and system pressed by the Park administration had its flaws. It came under fire for the contradictory logic that it was not aimed at getting rid of low-performing employees even though it was supposed to improve competitiveness in the public sector.
The performance-based salary system pushed by the Park Geun-hye administration is doomed by the Moon Jae-in government.
President Moon pledged to end it starting with the public sector.
Other policymaking roles also are hard to differentiate. It is unclear what makes the senior secretary for economic affairs under the Policy Office at the Blue House and the economic adviser to the chief of the Policy Office any different.
Of course, restoring the Policy Office and strengthening the presidential advisory team can help generate innovative ideas through competition.
Moreover, as Lee Yong-sup, vice chair of the committee under the president, is a heavyweight figure who had previously served in ministerial posts, he could have a bigger say in the process of creating jobs in the public and private sectors.

There are other hiccups. Cho Kuk, senior presidential secretary for civil affairs, reiterated that the president and government won’t meddle in prosecution probes. But Moon ordered the prosecution to reopen investigations into the sinking of the Sewol ferry and the power abuse scandal of his predecessor, who is already behind bars. He signed executive orders to repeal previous government’s policies on state publication of history textbooks and a ban on a controversial song as an official anthem for commemorations of the 1980 popular uprising in Gwangju. Although it is right to reverse unjust policies, they are not as urgent as the North Korean nuclear issue, job creation, and normalization of relations with neighboring countries.

Foreign and trade officials also must refine their response strategy as U.S administration under President Donald Trump could take retaliatory action to protect U.S. technology companies against the tax crackdown by other states.
Naver pursues frequent changes in order to constantly create new services through the collaboration of different departments as the IT industry is rapidly merging, integrating and changing.
The drawers that Naver employees use in the headquarters in Bundang, Gyeonggi Province, are about twice as larger as ordinary office drawers. When an employee is assigned to a different team within Naver, he or she doesn’t need to pack but put all personal belongings in these extra-large drawers. The drawers are wheeled and can be pushed to the new desk.

It is unclear whether the heat would continue onto Tuesday’s actual election day.
He then reinstated six Park loyalists who were partly responsible for Park’s fall.
But instead of setting the stage for an entirely new system, the race has been muddled with negative campaigning, groundless rumors and fake news.
The new administration will have a better chance to work with the National Assembly made up of multiple parties.
But if Moon keeps to his own people after winning, he cannot expect to draw cooperation from other parties.

But whether I am banned or not, I am happy to be a citizen of Korea, and until China becomes a truly great nation, I am determined not to visit China voluntarily. I hope to visit Pyongyang, but on a direct flight. Please don’t be mistaken. I am not anti-China, and I believe relations with China need to be mended some day.

The election is approaching, and my heart is racing.
When the international community joins hands in sanctions against the North, we can hardly take a different path as our nation’s survival is at stake. Our political parties, regardless of their ideological views, must demonstrate bipartisanship in confronting our greatest security risk.
If such reports prove true, the decades-old alliance between Seoul and Washington will surely face a serious crisis.
That would be a cataclysmic change way beyond China’s retaliations on South Korea for its decision to deploy the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system.

What the students wanted in education was less time in cram schools (741 cases), less testing (716 cases) and more arts and sports (630 cases). A Unicef survey of 29 countries found Korean children suffer from the most academic stress.
If young people have votes, it would have been different.
Many parents are aware of the problem.
The Global Times, one of the most belligerent official mouthpieces, lashed back at North Korea for threatening China’s security by raising the risk of a military clash on the Korean Peninsula through its unabated pursuit of nuclear weapons.
For our part, the government must do its best so as not to break the pace of joint sanctions on North Korea.
Our government must keep a close watch on all developments and prepare for such a dangerous turn of events.
But in essence, he wants to include the Self Defense Force in the new constitution to make it a legitimate military power.
He was more or less declaring a specific timetable to walk away from the postwar pacifist Constitution and legally revive the right for the nation to participate in war if necessary.
Japan over the years has contributed to peace and prosperity in the region.
In case of sudden changes in the North, China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could reach as far as the Chongchon River-Hamhung line, the bottleneck of the peninsula, with a justification to build refugee camps, said Dr. Bruce Bennett at the RAND Corporation.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially played the One China policy but stopped his provocation after the summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping. It can be deduced that Trump tossed the ball into China’s court by pressuring Beijing to resolve the crisis in the North Korea.
Voters should do their own research and believe in their own good judgment to make their choices.
If the president is elected through a low turnout, the nominee’s legitimacy will be challenged and will give the president trouble throughout his or her term.
They could check out their mail package or read up on the campaign pledges by all the candidates at the official website: centers can be located through the election information app. False and questionable polls, surveys and news have been rampant throughout the campaign.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he would be “honored” to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un under the “right it would be appropriate for me to meet with him, I would be honored to do it,” Trump told an interviewer. Although he didn’t spell out what the “right circumstances” would be — demonstrating evasiveness but also some sense of caution — we must note the use of the word see the comment as a gambit to pull Pyongyang to the negotiating table.

If he plans a supplementary budget in the first year, we can anticipate a fresh, new start of recovering a 3 percent growth rate.
But interested parties had a chance to have sufficient discussion and mediated with one another under less political is the message of the economy running smoothly in the absence of the president? An economy ministry official said, “The global economy is recovering, and the system supporting the Korean economy is working well.” Yet, the former presidents who called themselves “economy presidents” and micromanaged every single issue should learn a lesson. It has been proven that at least short-term economic indicators are not much related to the presidency.
Foreign investors are buying stocks and the Kospi is about to break the record high.
The defectors’ choice may be a realistic one, given calls from conservative voters for a single conservative candidate.
The conservative should concentrate on reviving a reasonable conservative path instead of going back to the old ways.
After bolting from the party, its members joined forces with the liberal camp to impeach Park.
Yet the candidates aspiring to become the next president are not taking the matter seriously.
U.S. President Donald Trump in an interview said he wished either to renegotiate or kill the FTA with Korea.
The Korean economy would be hit hard. A plunge in exports would translate into losses of 100,000 jobs.
There are many kinds of nuclear weapons.
Last weekend, James Woolsey, former CIA director during the Clinton Administration, warned of an EMP nuclear bomb possibly being developed by North Korea.
Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon dropped in Hiroshima, Japan in 1945, was an atomic bomb. It contained 64 kilograms of Uranium-234 and the nuclear fission yielded 15 kilotons of TNT. Fat Man dropped over Nagasaki a few days later used Plutonium-239 instead of are dirty bombs that result in a massive release of radioactivity. The hydrogen bomb developed in 1959 uses nuclear fusion rather than fission. It artificially recreates the process that occurs around the sun.
In the meantime, our diplomatic rivals Japan and China could probably instill bias against us into Trump’s mind to have the upper hand in such circumstances, we can expect nothing from our National Security Office chief. The discord over the cost of the Thaad battery has emerged as the top diplomatic priority for the new president after the May 9 election.
With China continuing to retaliate against Korea for the Thaad deployment, Koreans have to tackle unprecedented security risks from Trump’s America First policy.
Friction between Seoul and Washington over who should bear the cost of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system now deployed in Korea rings loud alarm bells in the alliance.
They advocated that the proposal to increase jobs through public sector hiring is aimed at compensating for market five candidates called for more aggressive fiscal spending to strengthen social security.
The five leading candidates for the 19th presidential election focused on the economy during the latest televised debate. None of them gave a clear picture on their economic direction and policies to address multiple challenges such as balancing growth and distribution, reforming the chaebol sector, leveling the corporate field, setting the economy on a sustainable growth pace through restructuring, strengthening social security or ensuring more jobs.
The Korean economy has been raising hopeful signs, growing at a faster-than-expected rate of 0.9 percent in the first quarter led by strong exports.
Pressuring with a pre-emptive attack could be a tactic for denuclearization but never a strategy for peaceful reunification.
The Trump administration and North Korea experts agree that Pyongyang will soon be able to attack New York and Washington. It is the solemn reality that the North Korean nuclear threat has reached a critical point where the possibility of a pre-emptive attack is a way to pressure Seoul needs to look at the reality in which pre-emptive strike is considered. We need to calmly review whether pre-emptive strike will help Korea’s future.
Moreover, a pre-emptive strike could be a simultaneous operation on not just nuclear facilities and warheads in the North but also ballistic missiles, long-range artilleries, airfields and command systems to prevent North Korea from striking back.
We had a similar experience in the 1994 Agreed Framework in Geneva between the U.S. and North Korea.
The Thaad battery is primarily aimed at safeguarding U.S. forces in South Korea from North Korea’s ballistic missile attacks.

In a board meeting on Thursday, Samsung Electronics decided to cancel all its existing and new treasury shares worth 49.3 trillion won ($43.35 billion). Its treasury stock holding of nearly 18 million common shares and 3.23 million preferred shares, which is tantamount to 13.3 percent of its outstanding issues, would be nullified. An additional 9.3 trillion won in buybacks would also head to the trash course, the cancellation of treasury stocks does not impair corporate value and can actually boost stock value due to reduced supply.
Across the Pacific, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed to slash corporate tax rate to 15 percent.
Buybacks and share cancellations are common practices to reward shareholders, along with dividend payouts. The news sent Samsung Electronics 2.4 percent up to a fresh record finish of 2,192,000 won per share.
The Trump administration is strongly pressing that the trade deficit of the United States increased due to Korea-U.S. FTA. Vice President Mike Pence and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross are attacking the FTA. The trade pressure could throw cold water on export recovery.
But the experts could not evaluate as the candidates have not made many campaign promises on the 19th presidential election, trade has been pushed aside. The candidates have yet to present a blueprint on how to maintain exports, which Korea heavily relies on, in the rising waves of protectionism. Especially since the Trump administration began, the possibility of renegotiating the free trade agreement between Korea and the U.S. is constantly mentioned, but the countermeasures cannot be found in the campaign Korea-U.S. relations, Democratic Party candidate Moon Jae-in stated that strategic partnership will continue based on the military alliance and FTA. Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party said he would pursue trade diplomacy based on the FTA and trade policy that has good cycle with domestic economy.

If North Korea fires back with its long-range multiple rocket launchers, a localized, if not full-scale, war is if the North comes back to the negotiating table, it
The North would only accept talks that seek to freeze its nuclear program, not end it.
But Trump’s message to Kim Jong-un is resolute: if North Korea does not come to the bargaining table, America could launch military attacks on its nuclear facilities.
The televised debate on Tuesday hosted by the JoongAng Ilbo, JTBC and the Korean Political Science Association drew the best-yet performance from the five main candidates for the May 9 presidential election.
Nevertheless, the televised debates still fail to live up to the standards of the audience.
Voters must pay close attention to the final two sessions to judge who is more fit to navigate this troubled country against multiple challenges.
The man took his own life after killing his daughter.
But there are no effective ways to go about it.
The murder-suicide illustrated the darkest side of social media.
He simply cannot allow Kim to threaten the U.S. mainland after wrapping up his nuclear weapons and long-range missile such a harsh reality, Thaad can serve a pivotal part in the Korea-U.S. alliance.
The deployment showed Uncle Sam’s intention to clear up all controversy by concluding the deployment before the May 9 presidential election.
With the possibility of Kim Jong-un giving up his nuclear ambition very low, U.S. President Donald Trump increasingly flexes his muscles.
Movements for merging presidential candidacy are being detected at three parties — the People’s Party whose contender has the biggest shot at beating Moon but distinctly lost steam after last weekend’s TV debate and the two conservative parties that broke apart from the ruling smallest Bareun Party, comprised of members that bolted out of the ruling Saenuri Party following the disgraceful scandal of former President Park Geun-hye, officially proposed a three-way alliance among its nominee Yoo Seong-min with Hong Joon-pyo of the bigger conservative Liberal Korea Party (LKP) and Ahn Cheol-soo of the People’s Party upon a surge in Moon’s rating after the second TV voters do not trust Moon’s policy on North Korea and his views on security affairs.

U.S. President Donald Trump pressured North Korea by directly talking with the leaders of China and Japan on the phone. On Monday, he invited members of the UN Security Council to the White House to urge them to prepare reinforced additional sanctions on Pyongyang. Trump once again sent stern messages that the United States will launch a pre-emptive strike on North Korean nuclear facilities if it crosses the red line, i.e.
